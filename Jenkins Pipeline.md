## What is a Jenkins Pipeline?
Jenkins Pipeline (or simply "Pipeline") is a suite of plugins which supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.
A continuous delivery pipeline is an automated expression of your process for getting software from version control right through to your users and customers.
Jenkins Pipeline provides an extensible set of tools for modeling simple-to-complex delivery pipelines "as code". The definition of a Jenkins Pipeline is typically written into a text file 
(called a Jenkinsfile) which in turn is checked into a projectâ€™s source control repository.
